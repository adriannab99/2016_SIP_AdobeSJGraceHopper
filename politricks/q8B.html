		<p>Going back to immigration, the Republican platform on immigration is quite simple.  If you enter legally, we'll warmly welcome you to our magnificent country. But if you enter illegally, you should not be given the same benefits as everyone else, and you should not receive amnesty, or an official pardon, for that only encourages more illegals to enter the country.  We do support more measures to increase border security and such to decrease the frequency of this heinous crime.

					<a href="q9.html">I think you're forgetting (in old age) that America was founded by immigrants, and continues to be enhanced by the skills of different people from all over the world!  You are so wrong I can't even deal.

					<a href="q9.html">Oh thank god someone agrees with me.  Those immigrants are nothing but trouble for our country.</a>
