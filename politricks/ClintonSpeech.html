	<ol>
		<li><font size="5">This is someone who has threatened to abandon our allies in NATO- the countries that work with us to root out terrorists abroad before they strike us at home.
He believes we can treat the U.S. economy like one of his casinos and default on our debts to the rest of the world, which would cause an economic catastrophe far worse than anything we experienced in 2008.</font></li>

		<li><font size="5">I went to 112 countries as your Secretary of State. And I never lost my sense of pride at seeing our blue-and-white plane lit up on some far-off runway, with "The United States of America" emblazoned on the side.</font></li>
		
		<div class = "radio" align="left"><br>

			<input id = "22" type="radio" name="q2" value=0>Circular Reasoning<br>
			<input id = "23" type="radio" name="q2" value=1>Neither
		</div><hr>

		<li><font size="5">This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes- because it's not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin. We cannot put the security of our children and grandchildren in Donald Trump's hands. We cannot let him roll the dice with America.</font></li>
		
		<div class = "radio" align="left"><br>
			<input id = "31" type="radio" name="q3" value=1>Personal Attack<br>

			<input id = "33" type="radio" name="q3" value=0>Neither
		</div><hr>
	
		<li><font size="5">Donald Trump's ideas aren't just different- they are dangerously incoherent. They're not even really ideas- just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds, and outright lies. He is not just unprepared- he is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility.</font></li>

		</div><hr>

		<li><font size="5">Because as you know so well, Americans aren't just electing a President in November. We're choosing our next commander-in-chief- the person we count on to decide questions of war and peace, life and death. And like many across our country and around the world, I believe the person the Republicans have nominated for President cannot do the job.</font></li>

			<input id = "63" type="radio" name="q6" value=0>Neither
		</div><hr>
		
		<li><font size="5">As Secretary of State, Senator and First Lady, I had the honor of representing America abroad and helping shape our foreign policy at home. As a candidate for President, there’s nothing I take more seriously than our national security. I've offered clear strategies for how to defeat ISIS, strengthen our alliances, and make sure Iran never gets a nuclear weapon. And I'm going to keep America's security at the heart of my campaign.</font></li>

		</div><hr>
		
		<li><font size="5">That's what I want to speak about today- the challenges we face in protecting our country, and the choice at stake in this election. It's a choice between a fearful America that's less secure and less engaged with the world, and a strong, confident America that leads to keep our country safe and our economy growing.</font></li>
