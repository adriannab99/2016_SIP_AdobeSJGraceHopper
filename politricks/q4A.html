			When it comes to the economy, us <a href="http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/american-politics/beliefs-of-the-republican-party/"target="_blank" > Republicans</a> strongly believe in the free market, which is basically where all people can barter and trade without any government interference.  We think that all Americans have the right to own, invest, build, and prosper based on their stellar personal qualities!		</p>
