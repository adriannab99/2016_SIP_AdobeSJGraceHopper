			That's quite rude young lady...or man... I can't actually see you since I'm just an image on a computer. ANYWAYS that man could be our next President, and we all know about his feelings towards deportation!

		<p>
			>> Do your job, old man.
		</p>
		<p>
			*Thumps trunk* Yes well, where was I...
		</p>
		<p>
			>> The wall- seriously, do they pay you?

			How rude... well, the Republican platform on immigration is quite simple.  If you enter legally, we'll warmly welcome you to our magnificent country.
		</p>
		<p>
			>> *cough*
		</p>
		<p>
			*sniffs* But if you enter illegally, you should not be given the same benefits as everyone else, and you should not receive amnesty, or an official pardon, for that only encourages more illegals to enter the country.  We do support more measures to increase border security and such to decrease the frequency of this crime.
