			Going back to gun control in ..3..2..1 Good ole <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" target="_blank">Second Amendment</a>, that's for sure.  All kidding aside, we believe, in general, that the government should have as few regulations as possible, and we especially think that our right to own a gun should not be taken away.  However, we do not think that everyone should own a gun, and those regulations need to be discussed at a state, not national level.</p>
