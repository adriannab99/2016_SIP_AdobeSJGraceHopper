			Now, time for one of my personal favorites. *sips tea*  Well, yes, it is true that most of us oppose gay marriage.  However, that does not mean that we are homophobes, but rather that marriage was defined a certain way by the founding fathers, and that gay marriage compromises the sanctity of marriage.  Also, many of us think that a household with a man and woman is the healthiest way to raise a child.  Another common stance is that that states should have the most control regarding laws about gay marriage and recognizing it.
